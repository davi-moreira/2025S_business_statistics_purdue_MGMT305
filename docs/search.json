Under this policy, the overall GPA for this class can be no higher than 3.0. To comply with this course policy, final course letter grades will be based on the curved class final course percentages. The final course percentage is based on a weighted percentage computed using the weights shown in the table below:\n\n\n\nAssignment\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nHomework*\n40%\n\n\nQuizzes**\n15%\n\n\nMidterms***\n15%\n\n\nAttendance/Participation\n7%\n\n\nFinal****\n23%\n\n\n\n*There are eight homework assignments. No homework assignment is dropped. The final homework score is calculated using aggregated points.\n**There are three quizzes worth 5% each. Quizzes 2 and 3 are not cumulative.\n***There are two midterms: each is worth 7.5%. Midterms are not cumulative.\n**** Final is cumulative.\n\n\nHomework\nHomework assignments are uploaded to Brightspace and must be submitted as a single PDF or Word file with all relevant outputs. Late submissions are not accepted. Ensure to:\n\nInclude all software outputs addressing the homework questions.\nClearly identify each problem with its respective chapter and problem number.\nDo not copy and paste datasets into your submissions.\n\nDiscuss problems with classmates, but ensure individual submissions. Duplicate papers are considered cheating.\n\n\nQuizzes and Exams\n\nQuizzes: Three quizzes will be given, with none being cumulative. Exceptional circumstances for make-ups require documentation.\nExams: Two midterms (7.5% each) and one final (23%) will test technical and conceptual understanding. Calculators without internet access are required. Makeup exams are only granted for documented exceptional circumstances.\n\n\n\nAttendance and Participation\nRandom attendance will be recorded through participation activities during class time. Participation in class discussions is essential and will influence the grade.\n\n\nGrade Challenges\nChallenges to grades must be submitted within 7 calendar days of the grade announcement, with the exception of the final homework, which has a 3-day window. Provide specific details and reasons for challenges via email.\n\n\nExtra Credit Opportunity\nA bonus will be provided if at least 85% of the class completes the midterm and/or final course evaluations.",

Is it correct to conclude that the electric power consumption is decreasing?\nWe must be careful with such information, because whenever a seasonal influence is present, such comparisons may be misleading if the data have not been deseasonalized.\nThe fact that electric power consumption is down 3% from August to September might be only the seasonal effect associated with a decrease in the use of air conditioning and not because of a long-term decline in the use of electric power.\nIndeed, after adjusting for the seasonal effect, we might even find that the use of electric power increased.\nMany other time series, such as unemployment statistics, home sales, and retail sales, are subject to strong seasonal influences. It is important to deseasonalize such data before making a judgment about any long-term trend."

This indicates that the plan is nearly adequate in terms of the consumer’s risk, but it is still slightly above the target.\nConclusion: The acceptance sampling plan \\((n, c) = (15, 0)\\) is not acceptable because it does not adequately meet the producer’s risk requirement.

Tools like control charts, SPC, and acceptance sampling are critical.\nStatistical Process Control (SPC): SPC uses control charts to monitor and maintain process stability by identifying common and assignable causes of variation.\nControl Charts: Used to monitor different quality metrics, such as the mean (\\(\\bar{X}\\)), variability (R-chart), and defect proportion (p-chart). Control limits are established to detect out-of-control conditions and require adjustments only for assignable causes.\nAcceptance Sampling: Provides a practical method for lot quality decisions without inspecting every item. It balances producer’s and consumer’s risks by setting limits on acceptable defect rates.\nMultiple Sampling Plans: These plans, including the two-stage acceptance sampling plan, can minimize sample size while maintaining error controls, improving efficiency over single-stage plans."

To recap from previous slides:\n\nThe Optimal Decision Strategy for PDC is to conduct the market research study and then carry out the following decision strategy, with EV = 15.93:\n\nIf the market research is favorable: Construct the large condominium complex to maximize profits (\\(d_3\\)) with EV = 18.26.\nIf the market research is unfavorable: Construct the medium condominium complex as a safer choice under lower demand expectations (\\(d_2\\)) with EV = 8.15."

    "text": "Summary\n\n\nSome key takeaways from this session:\n\nDecision Analysis Structure: A structured approach using payoff tables and decision trees allows for organized, strategic decision-making, particularly in uncertain conditions.\nExpected Value Approach: By calculating expected values across different states of nature, we can identify optimal decisions based on probabilistic outcomes, maximizing potential profits.\nValue of Information:\n\nExpected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI): Quantifies the benefit of having certainty about future states, guiding decision-makers on how much to invest in obtaining information.\nExpected Value of Sample Information (EVSI): Measures the potential benefit of additional data (e.g., market research), providing insight on the value of partial or imperfect information.\n\nBayes’ Theorem in Decision Trees: Allows for updating probabilities based on new evidence (e.g., favorable or unfavorable reports) to make more informed, dynamic decisions.\nDecision Trees with Probabilities: Decision trees not only display possible decisions and outcomes but, with added probabilities, allow for more precise expected value calculations.\nOptimal Decision Strategy: Analyzing decision trees and recalculating with updated probabilities leads to a final strategy that maximizes expected outcomes based on the best available information."

Missing class negatively impacts your ability to succeed.\n\n\n\nHomework\n\nEight homework assignments; none are dropped.\n\nHomework must be submitted on Brightspace by the deadline in a single PDF or Word file, with all relevant Excel (or other) outputs included and clearly referenced.\n\nSubmissions:\n\nYou have 2 attempts to upload your assignment; only the second is graded if you use both attempts.\n\nNo late homework or email submissions are accepted.\n\n\nYou may discuss homework with classmates, but copying or duplicate submissions are considered cheating.\n\n\n\nQuizzes\n\nThree quizzes, each worth 5%. Quizzes 2 and 3 are not cumulative.\n\nMake-up quizzes are only allowed under exceptional circumstances (e.g., verifiable medical emergencies, conflicting NCAA events).\n\n\n\nMidterms\n\nTwo midterms, each worth 15%. Neither is cumulative.\n\nExams test technical calculation skills and conceptual understanding similar to homework problems.\n\nCalculators without internet or USB capabilities are allowed; phones/watches are not.\n\n\n\nFinal\n\nCumulative in-person exam.\n\nBring an approved calculator as described above.\n\n\n\nGrade Challenges\n\nChallenges to any quiz/exam or homework grade must be made by email within 7 calendar days of the grade announcement on Brightspace (3 days for the last homework).\nProvide your name, ID, assignment/exam number, and a specific explanation of the disputed deduction.\nAfter the window closes, the posted grades are final.",
