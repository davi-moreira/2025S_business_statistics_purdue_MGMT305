## Omitted Variables (Confounders)

-   One of the most common errors in observational studies (besides selection bias and information bias — classification or measurement error);

-   It occurs when we suggest that the explanation for something is "confounded" with the effect of another variable;

-   For example, "the sun rose because the rooster crowed," and not because of Earth's rotation.

## How to Address Omitted Variable Bias?

-   Be well-versed in the literature;

-   Select good control variables for your model;

-   That is, perform a **multiple regression model**.

# Multiple Regression {background-color="#cfb991"}

## Multiple Regression

-   Regression analysis involving two or more independent variables (x's).

-   This subject area, called multiple regression analysis, enables us to consider more independent variables (factors) and thus obtain better estimates of the relationship than are possible with simple linear regression.

## Multiple Regression Model

The equation that describes how the dependent variable $y$ is related to the independent variables $x_1, x_2, \ldots x_p$ and an error term $\epsilon$ is:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \dots + \beta_p x_p + \epsilon
$$

Where:

-   $\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \dots, \beta_p$ are the unknown parameters.

-   $\epsilon$ is a random variable called the error term with the same assumptions as in simple regression (Normality, zero mean, constant variance, independence).

-   $p$ is the number of independent variables (dimension or complexity of the model).

## Multiple Regression Equation

The equation that describes how the mean value of $y$ is related to $x_1, x_2, \ldots x_p$ is:

$$
E(y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \dots + \beta_p x_p
$$

$\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p$ measure the marginal effects of the respective independent variables.

<br>

For example, $\beta_1$ is the change in $E(y)$ corresponding to a 1-unit increase in $x_1$, when all other independent variables are held constant or when we control for all other independent variables.

## Estimated Multiple Regression Equation

<br>

$$
\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x_1 + b_2 x_2 + \dots + b_p x_p
$$

A simple random sample is used to compute sample slopes $b_0, b_1, b_2, \dots, b_p$ that are used as the point estimators of the population slopes $\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \dots, \beta_p$.

<br>

Hence, $\hat{y}$ estimates $E(Y)$.

# Least Squares Method {background-color="#cfb991"}

## Least Squares Method

<br>

Least Squares Criterion: Minimize the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE):

$$
\min \sum (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2
$$

Where $y_i - \hat{y_i}$ is the $i$-th residual/error.

<br>

-   The formulas for the regression coefficients $b_0, b_1, b_2, \dots, b_p$ involve the use of matrix algebra. We will rely on computer software packages to perform the calculations.

-   The emphasis will be on how to interpret the computer output rather than on how to make the multiple regression computations.

## Multiple Regression Model

**Example: Butler Trucking Company**

Managers at Butler Trucking Company want to develop better work schedules for their drivers. They believe that the total daily travel time would be closely related to the number of miles traveled in making the daily deliveries and also to the number of deliveries.

A simple random sample of 10 driving assignments was taken.

## Multiple Regression Model

**Example**: Butler Trucking Company - `Butler.xlsx`

| Driving Assignment | Miles traveled $x_1$ | Deliveries $x_2$ | $y$ = Travel Time (hours) |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| 1 | 100 | 4 | 9.3 |
| 2 | 50 | 3 | 4.8 |
| 3 | 100 | 4 | 8.9 |
| 4 | 100 | 2 | 6.5 |
| 5 | 50 | 2 | 4.2 |
| 6 | 80 | 2 | 6.2 |
| 7 | 75 | 3 | 7.4 |
| 8 | 65 | 4 | 6.0 |
| 9 | 90 | 3 | 7.6 |
| 10 | 90 | 2 | 6.1 |

## Multiple Regression Model

**Example: Butler Trucking Company**

Suppose we believe that total daily travel time ($y$) is related to the miles traveled ($x_1$) and the number of deliveries made ($x_2$) by the following multiple linear regression model:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \epsilon
$$

Where:

-   $y$ = Total travel time

-   $x_1$ = Miles traveled

-   $x_2$ = Deliveries made

-   $n = 10, p = 2$

For observation #1 where $x_1 = 100$, $x_2 = 4$, and $y = 9.3$:

$$
\hat{y} = -0.8687 + 0.0611(100) + 0.9234(4) = 8.9385
$$

Unexplained residual = $y - \hat{y} = 9.3 - 8.9385 = 0.3615$
:::

## Interpreting the Regression Coefficients

<br>

Each $b_i$ (for $x_i$) represents an estimate of the change in the expected $y$ corresponding to a 1-unit increase in $x_i$, when all other independent variables are held constant or when we control for all other independent variables.

-   SSE = Sum of squares due to error (unexplained variation of residuals)

-   $n$ = sample size.

-   $p$ = number of predictors (independent variables).

|------------|-----|---------|---------|---------|----------------|
| Regression | 2   | 21.6006 | 10.8003 | 32.8784 | 0.0003         |
| Residual   | 7   | 2.2994  | 0.3285  |         |                |
| Total      | 9   | 23.9    |         |         |                |

## Multiple Coefficient of Determination

**Example: Butler Trucking Company**

$$
R^2 = \frac{SSR}{SST} = 1 - \frac{SSE}{SST}
$$

$$
R^2 = \frac{21.6006}{23.9} = 1 - \frac{2.2994}{23.9} = 90.38\%
$$

$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{SSE / (n - 1)}{SST / (n - 1)} = 1 - \frac{\text{Residual variance}}{\text{Response variance}}
$$

## Remarks on Multiple Coefficient of Determination

-   Adding independent variables, even ones that are not statistically significant, will reduce the prediction errors, thus the SSE will become smaller.

-   Because SST = SSR + SSE is fixed, SSR will become larger, SSE will become smaller, and hence, $R^2 = SSR/SST$ will always increase.

-   But, adding independent variables, the model will become more complex (a larger $p$).

## Adjusted Multiple Coefficient of Determination

<br>

The **adjusted multiple coefficient of determination** ($R^2_a$) takes into account the following factors:

-   The number of independent variables in the model ($p$, dimension or complexity)

-   The $R^2$ (Adequacy)

-   The sample size ($n$, available information)

## Adjusted Multiple Coefficient of Determination

**Example**: Butler Trucking Company

$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{SSE}{SST} = 90.38\%
$$

$$
R^2_a = 1 - \frac{\frac{SSE}{(n - p - 1)}}{\frac{SST}{(n - 1)}} = 1 - (1 - R^2) \cdot \frac{n - 1}{n - p - 1}
$$

$$
R^2_a = 1 - \frac{2.2994 / (10 - 2 - 1)}{23.9 / (10 - 1)} = 1 - (1 - 0.9038) \cdot \frac{10 - 1}{10 - 2 - 1} = 87.63\%
$$

## Adjusted Multiple Coefficient of Determination

$$
R^2_a = 1 - \frac{\frac{SSE}{(n - p - 1)}}{\frac{SST}{(n - 1)}} = 1 - \frac{MSE}{\frac{SST}{(n - 1)}} = 1 - \frac{S^2}{\frac{SST}{(n - 1)}}
$$

<br>

A smaller $S^2$ gives a higher $R^2_a$.

Bringing in a new independent variable will increase the $R^2_a$ when and only when it can decrease the estimated error variance ($S^2$ or MSE). Hence, $R^2_a$ is a good criterion for **model building or model selection**.

<br>

*(Recall: MSE or* $S^2$ estimates the error variance $\sigma^2$.)

# Testing for Significance {background-color="#cfb991"}

## Testing for Significance

-   In simple linear regression, the F and $t$ Tests provide the same conclusion:
    -   They are equivalen$t$ Tests: Squared t-value = F-value.
    -   They have the same p-value.
-   In multiple regression, the F and $t$ Tests have different purposes and are not equivalent.

## Testing for Overall Significance: $F$ Test

-   The $F$ Test is used to determine whether a significant linear relationship exists between the dependent variable and the set of all the independent variables, by testing their population slopes ($\beta_1, \dots, \beta_p$) together as a group.

-   The $F$ Test is referred to as the test for overall significance.

## Testing for Overall Significance: $F$ Test

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
**Hypotheses**

$$
H_0: \beta_1 = \beta_2 = \dots = \beta_p = 0 \quad (\text{No linear relationship})
$$

$$
H_a: \text{One or more of the slopes is not equal to zero}
$$

**Test Statistics**

$$
F = \frac{MSR}{MSE}
$$ where,

$$
MSR = \frac{SSR}{p} \quad \text{and} \quad MSE = \frac{SSE}{n-p-1}
$$

**Rejection Rule**

Reject $H_0$ if $F \geq F_\alpha$ or $p \leq \alpha$.

where $F_\alpha$ is based on an $F$ distribution with $p$ d.f. (numerator) and $n - p - 1$ d.f. (denominator).
:::

## Testing for Overall Significance: $F$ Test

**Example: Butler Trucking Company**

**Hypotheses:**

$$
H_0: \beta_1 = \beta_2 = 0
$$

$$
H_a: \text{One or both slopes are not equal to zero}
$$

**Rejection Rule**

For $\alpha = 0.01$ and degrees of freedom = 2 and 7, $F_{\alpha} = 9.55$.

Reject $H_0$ if $F \geq 9.55$ or $p \leq .01$.

## Testing for Overall Significance: $F$ Test

**Test Statistics**

$$
F = \frac{MSR}{MSE} = \frac{10.8003}{0.3285} = 32.8784
$$

**Conclusion:**

We reject $H_0$ because $F = 32.8784 > 9.55$.

We have significant statistical evidence to conclude that at least one of the independent variables is useful in explaining the variation in the total travel time, or for predicting the total travel time. The significance level is 1%.

$$
p-value = 1 - F.DIST(32.8784, 2, 7, TRUE) \approx 0.0003
$$

## Testing for Individual Significance: $t$ Test

-   If the $F$ test shows an overall significance, a separate $t$ test is conducted for each of the independent variables in the model.

-   The $t$ test is used to determine whether each of the individual independent variables is significant **in the presence of all other independent variables in the model**.

    -   It tests the **additional contribution** in reducing the variation of the unexplained error (or in increasing the explained variation).

-   We refer to each of these $t$ tests as a test for individual significance.

## Testing for Individual Significance: $t$ Test

**Hypotheses**

$$
H_0: \beta_i = 0 \quad (x_i \text{ is not significant in the presence of all other } x's)
$$

$$
H_a: \beta_i \neq 0
$$

**Test Statistic**

$$
t = \frac{b_i - 0}{s_{b_i}} \quad (s_{b_i} \text{ is the standard error of } b_i)
$$

**Rejection Rule**

Reject $H_0$ if $t \leq -t_{\alpha / 2}$ or $t \geq t_{\alpha / 2}$ or if $p$-value $\leq \alpha$.

where $t_{\alpha/2}$ is based on a $t$-distribution with $n - p - 1$ degrees of freedom.

## Testing for Individual Significance: $t$ Test

**Example: Butler Trucking Company**

-   $H_0: \beta_i = 0$
-   $H_a: \beta_i \neq 0 \quad \text{(Two-tailed)}$

::: fragment
For $\alpha = 0.01$ and $df = 7$:

$$
t_{0.005} = 3.499
$$

Reject $H_0$ if $p$-value $\leq .01$, or if $t \leq -3.499$ or $t \geq 3.499$.
:::

## Testing for Individual Significance: $t$ Test

**Test Statistics**

$$
t = \frac{b_1 - 0}{s_{b_1}} = \frac{0.0611 - 0}{0.0099} = 6.1717, \quad \text{for } x_1
$$

$$
t = \frac{b_2 - 0}{s_{b_2}} = \frac{0.9234 - 0}{0.2211} = 4.1764, \quad \text{for } x_2
$$

**Conclusion**

Reject each of $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$ and $H_0: \beta_2 = 0$. Each independent variable is statistically significant **in the presence of the other**.

# Multicollinearity {background-color="#cfb991"}

## Multicollinearity

-   The term **multicollinearity** refers to the correlation among the independent variables.

-   It is important to compute pairwise correlations in a multiple regression analysis.

-   **Rule of Thumb**: When independent variables are highly correlated (e.g., $|r| > 0.7$), it is difficult to determine the separate/marginal effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable.

-   Every attempt should be made to avoid including independent variables that are highly correlated.

-   If the estimated regression equation is to be used only for predictive purposes, multicollinearity is usually not a serious problem

## Multicollinearity

-   The coefficients do not measure marginal effects of the predictors (rather **combined** effects may be measured).

-   Coefficient estimates (b’s) are **unstable** (having “inflated” standard errors — also see **Variance Inflation Factor, VIF**).

    -   **Nonsignificant** test results for important predictor variables.
    -   Estimated regression coefficients with an algebraic sign that is the **opposite** of what is expected from theoretical considerations or prior experience.
    -   **Large changes** in the estimated regression coefficients (slopes) when a predictor variable is added or deleted.
    -   **Wide confidence intervals** for the regression coefficients representing important predictor variables.

# Estimation and Prediction {background-color="#cfb991"}

## Estimation and Prediction

-   The procedures for estimating the mean value of $y$ and predicting an individual value of $y$ in multiple regression are similar to those in simple regression.

-   We substitute the given values of $x_1, x_2, ..., x_p$ into the estimated regression equation and use the corresponding value of $\hat{y}$ as the point estimate.

-   The interpretations of the Confidence Interval (CI) and Prediction Interval (PI) in multiple regression are similar to those in simple regression:

    -   The Confidence Interval (CI) estimates the range within which the mean value of the dependent variable is expected to lie, given specific values of the independent variables.
    -   The Prediction Interval (PI) estimates the range within which an individual observation of the dependent variable is expected to lie, given specific values of the independent variables.

<br>

-   The formulas required to develop interval estimates, CI and PI, are beyond the scope of the course and our textbook. Software packages for multiple regression will often provide these interval estimates.

# Categorical Independent Variables {background-color="#cfb991"}

## Categorical Independent Variables

-   In many situations, we need to work with categorical independent variables such as gender (an independent variable with 2 categories: Male, Female), method of payment (an independent variable with 3 categories: Cash, Check, Credit card), etc.

-   Need to code categorical independent variables. For example, if $x_2$ is a gender variable, let $x_2 = 1$ for males and $x_2 = 0$ for females.

-   In this case, $x_2$ is called a dummy or indicator variable, and the category with a 0 (i.e., female) is called the reference category or level.

## Categorical Independent Variables

-   Gender: F, M
-   Job Type: Lawyer, Salesperson, Educator, Government (for salary)
-   Tool Type: A, B, C (for yields)
-   Region: NE, NW, SE, SW (for sales)
-   Season (for sales)
-   Training Method: Online, Hybrid, In-person (for learning outcome)
-   Position: Manager, AVP, Senior VP, Chair (for retirement age)
-   Advertising Media: Newspaper, Magazine, Spot TV (for sales)
-   Smoker: Yes, No (for health risk)
-   Method of Payment: Cash, Check, Credit Card (for credit rating or loan approvals)

## Categorical Independent Variables

**Example: Johnson Filtration, Inc.**

Managers of Johnson Filtration, Inc. want to predict the repair time necessary for processing its maintenance requests. Repair time is believed to be related to two factors, the number of months since last service and the type of repair problem (mechanical or electrical). Data for a sample of 10 service calls are reported in the table (next slide).

## Categorical Independent Variables

**Example: Johnson Filtration, Inc.**

Regression model:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \epsilon
$$

Where:\
$y$ = Repair time in hours\
$x_1$ = Number of months since last maintenance service\
$x_2$ = 0 if type of repair is mechanical, 1 if the type of repair is electrical ( $x_2$ is a dummy variable)

## Categorical Independent Variables

**Example: Johnson Filtration, Inc.**

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/multiple_reg_categorical_iv.png")
```

<br>

## Categorical Independent Variables

Interpretation of regression coefficient $\beta_2$ of dummy variable $x_2$:

$$
E(y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2
$$

For mechanical (reference):\
$$
E(y|mechanical) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 \cdot 0 = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1
$$

For electrical:\
$$
E(y|electrical) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 \cdot 1 = (\beta_0 + \beta_2) + \beta_1 x_1 
$$

## Categorical Independent Variables

-   The mean repair time is a linear function of $x_1$ for both mechanical and electrical repairs.

-   The slope of both equations is $\beta_1$, but the y-intercept differs:

    -   For mechanical repairs: the y-intercept is $\beta_0$.
    -   For electrical repairs: the y-intercept is $\beta_0 + \beta_2$.

-   The coefficient $\beta_2$ indicates the difference between the mean repair time for electrical repairs and the mean repair time for mechanical repairs.

## Interpretation of $\beta_2$

-   **If** $\beta_2$ is positive: The mean repair time for an electrical repair is greater than for a mechanical repair.

-   **If** $\beta_2$ is negative: The mean repair time for an electrical repair is less than for a mechanical repair.

-   **If** $\beta_2 = 0$: There is no difference in the mean repair time between electrical and mechanical repairs, indicating that the type of repair is not related to repair time.

-   In effect, the use of the dummy variable for type of repair provides two estimated regression equations that can be used to predict the repair time.

```

<br>

## More Complex Categorical Variables

> A categorical variable with $k$ levels must be modeled using $k - 1$ dummy variables. Care must be taken in defining and interpreting the dummy variables.

-   In the Johnson Filtration example, a categorical variable (mechanical and electrical) with two levels was represented by a single dummy variable.

-   When a categorical variable has more than two levels, $k - 1$ dummy variables are required, with each coded as 0 or 1.

## Example: Categorical Variable with Three Levels

-   Suppose a manufacturer organizes the sales territories into three regions: A, B, and C.

-   The number of copiers sold per week is the dependent variable.

-   The sales region is a categorical variable with three levels: A, B, and C.

::: fragment
**Dummy Variables for Sales Region:** We need $3 - 1 = 2$ dummy variables.

$$
x_1 = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if sales region B} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

$$
x_2 = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if sales region C} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
:::

## Example: Dummy Variable Coding

-   The following table shows the coding for the dummy variables $x_1$ and $x_2$ for each sales region.

::: fragment
| Region | $x_1$ | $x_2$ |
|--------|-------|-------|
| A      | 0     | 0     |
| B      | 1     | 0     |
| C      | 0     | 1     |
:::

-   Observations corresponding to region A are coded $x_1 = 0,  x_2 = 0$.
-   Observations corresponding to region B are coded $x_1 = 1,  x_2 = 0$.
-   Observations corresponding to region C are coded $x_1 = 0,  x_2 = 1$.

## Example: Regression Equation with Dummy Variables

:::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
-   The regression equation for the expected number of units sold is:

::: fragment
$$
E(y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2
$$
:::

-   To interpret the parameters $\beta_0,  \beta_1,  \beta_2$, consider the three variations of the regression equation:

-   **Region A**: $$
    E(y | \text{region A}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 (0) + \beta_2 (0) = \beta_0
    $$

-   **Region B**: $$
    E(y | \text{region B}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 (1) + \beta_2 (0) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 
    $$

-   **Region C**: $$
    E(y | \text{region C}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 (0) + \beta_2 (1) = \beta_0 + \beta_2
    $$

-   Interpretation:

    -   $\beta_0$: Mean or expected value of sales for region A.
    -   $\beta_1$: Difference in mean sales between region B and region A.
    -   $\beta_2$: Difference in mean sales between region C and region A.
::::

## Example: Important Points on Dummy Variables

-   Two dummy variables are used because the sales region has three levels.

-   The assignment of $x_1 = 0, x_2 = 0$ for region A is arbitrary.

-   Alternative coding choices are possible, which would change the interpretation of $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$.

-   **Key Point**: For a categorical variable with $k$ levels, $k - 1$ dummy variables are required.

    -   For a fourth region $D$, we would need three dummy variables.

## Assumptions about the Error Term $\epsilon$ in the Multiple Regression Model

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
Consider the following two-independent-variable multiple regression equation:

$$
E(y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2
$$
:::

<br>

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/multiple_regression_plot.png")
```

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
The graph of this equation is a plane in three-dimensional space. The value of $\epsilon$ shown is the difference between the actual $y$ value and the expected value of $y$, $E(y)$, when $x_1 = x_1^*$ and $x_2 = x_2^*$.
:::

<br>

## Assumptions about the Error Term $\epsilon$ in the Multiple Regression Model

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \cdots + \beta_p x_p + \epsilon
$$

1.  **The error term** $\epsilon$ is a random variable with $E(\epsilon) = 0$.

-   **Implication**: For given values of $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_p$, the expected, or average, value of $y$ is given by:

::: fragment
$$
E(y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \cdots + \beta_p x_p
$$
:::

-   **Validation**: Residuals vs. Predicted Values Plot or the Standardized Residuals vs. Predicted Values Plot

2.  **The variance of** $\epsilon$ is denoted by $\sigma^2$ and is the same for all values of the independent variables $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_p$.

-   **Implication**: The variance of $y$ about the regression line equals $\sigma^2$ and is the same for all values of $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_p$.

-   **Validation**: Residuals vs. Predicted Values Plot or the Standardized Residuals vs. Predicted Values Plot

## Assumptions about the Error Term $\epsilon$ in the Multiple Regression Model

3.  **The values of** $\epsilon$ are independent.

    -   **Implication**: The value of $\epsilon$ for a particular set of values for the independent variables is not related to the value of $\epsilon$ for any other set of values.

    -   **Validation**: Standardized Residuals vs. Predicted Values Plot

4.  **The error term** $\epsilon$ is a normally distributed random variable reflecting the deviation between the $y$ value and the expected value of $y$.

    -   **Implication**: Because $\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p$ are constants for the given values of $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_p$, the dependent variable $y$ is also a normally distributed random variable.

    -   **Validation**: Normal Probability Plot or Q-Q Plot (Quantile-Quantile Plot) of Residuals.

# Residual Analysis {background-color="#cfb991"}

## Residual Analysis

-   For simple linear regression, the residual plot against $\hat{y}$ and the residual plot against $x$ provide the same information.

-   In multiple regression analysis, it is preferable to use the residual plot against $\hat{y}$ to determine if the model assumptions are satisfied.

## Standardized Residuals

-   Standardized residuals are frequently used in residual plots for purposes of:

    -   Identifying outliers (typically, standardized residuals $< -2$ or $> +2$)
    -   Providing insight about the assumption that the error term $\epsilon$ has a normal distribution, using the Empirical Rule.

-   The computation of standardized residuals in multiple regression analysis is too complex to be done by hand.

    -   Excel’s Regression tool can be used.

-   Normality of residuals can be checked by the normal probability plot.

## Standardized Residuals

**Example: Butler Trucking Company: Residual output**

<br>

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/butler_company_residual_output_excel.png")
```

## Standardized Residual Plot Against $\hat{y}$

**Example: Butler Trucking Company**

<br>

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/butler_company_residual_plot_excel.png")
```

<br>

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
-   The standardized residual plot does not indicate any abnormalities, and no standard residual is less than -2 or greater than +2.
-   Note: the pattern of the standardized residual plot against $\hat{y}$ is the same as the pattern of the residual plot against $\hat{y}$. But the standardized residual plot enables us to check for outliers and determine whether the assumption of normality for the regression model (Distribution of $y$) is reasonable.

# Adding or Removing Independent Variables? {background-color="#cfb991"}

## Adding or Removing Independent Variables?

-   If adding a predictor to a model can lower the estimated error variance $S^2$, then adding it will increase Adjusted $R^2$.

-   **Definition**: A predictor is said to be an **ineffective predictor** if its $|T\text{-value}|$

    -   $\frac{|b-0|}{se(b)} < 1$ (coefficient estimate $b$ is within one standard deviation from 0), or its two-sided p-value $> 0.32$.
    -   Adding an ineffective predictor will decrease Adjusted $R^2$.
    -   Removing an ineffective predictor will increase Adjusted $R^2$.
    -   We will be penalized for including ineffective predictors.

## Model and Interpretation

**Regression Model (assume category C is the reference category):**

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot (DA) + \beta_2 \cdot (DB) + 0 \cdot (DC) + \epsilon
$$

or

$$
E(Y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot (DA) + \beta_2 \cdot (DB) + 0 \cdot (DC)
$$

$\beta_1$: slope of DA - the difference in $E(Y)$ between the category that DA represents and the reference category.

$\beta_2$: slope of DB - the difference in $E(Y)$ between the category that DB represents and the reference category.

## Model and Interpretation (cont'd)

**Regression Model (Use Method C as the reference method):**

$$
E(Y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot (DA) + \beta_2 \cdot (DB) + 0 \cdot (DC)
$$

$\mu_C = \beta_0$ for Method C\
$\mu_A = \beta_0 + \beta_1$ for Method A\
$\mu_B = \beta_0 + \beta_2$ for Method B

## Hypotheses

**Test of Overall Significance (**$F$ test):

$H_0: \beta_1 = \beta_2 = 0$ (i.e., $\mu_A = \mu_B = \mu_C$, and Method is insignificant)

**Test of individual significance (**$t$ test):

$H_0: \beta_1 = 0$ (i.e., $\mu_A - \mu_C = 0$)\
$H_0: \beta_2 = 0$ (i.e., $\mu_B - \mu_C = 0$)

## Excel Output

```

<br>

-   Reject $H_0$ at $\alpha$ = 5%.

-   Overall, the assembly method is a significant factor.

## Details of the $F$-Test

<br>

**Test Statistic:**

$F = MSTR/MSE = 260/28.3333 = 9.1765$

<br>

**Decision Rule: Critical-value approach**

Reject $H_0$ if $F \geq 3.8853$

where $3.8853 = F_{0.05} = F.INV(0.95, 2, 12)$ is the 5% upper critical value.

```

Where,

$p$-value = 1 – `F.DIST(9.1765, 2, 12, TRUE)` $\approx 0.0038$

-   There is sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that at least two mean numbers of units produced are not equal and hence the Assembly Method is significant. The significance level is 5%.

## Summary

::: nonincremental
Some key takeaways from this session:

-   Multiple regression analysis enables the inclusion of more independent variables, improving estimates over simple regression.

-   The **multiple regression model** describes how the dependent variable is related to multiple independent variables.

-   **Least Squares Method** is used to estimate the coefficients by minimizing the sum of squared errors.

-   Adjusted $R^2$ accounts for the number of predictors, making it a more reliable criterion for model selection.

-   **Multicollinearity** can affect the stability of coefficient estimates and make it difficult to isolate the effects of individual predictors.

-   Dummy variables can be used to incorporate categorical variables in regression models.

-   The overall significance of the model is tested using the **F-test**, while individual predictors are tested using **t-tests**.
